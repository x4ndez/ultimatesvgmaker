## Description
This application is the week 10 project of the edX/Monash bootcamp with a focus on Object-Orientated Programming and testing.  The task was to build an SVG based off user input from the terminal using the Inquirer module.  I personally liked this method of coding, as it kept everything organised and reusable.  As for testing the application, I used the jest module.  During the week when we were learning to use jest, I was fairly confused for why we were using it, but after I took some time to read over it and understand the syntax, it all made sense and I was able to feature it into my application without any troubles!

The acceptance criteria of this project were as follows:

```md
GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
WHEN I am prompted for text
THEN I can enter up to three characters
WHEN I am prompted for the text color
THEN I can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number)
WHEN I am prompted for a shape
THEN I am presented with a list of shapes to choose from: circle, triangle, and square
WHEN I am prompted for the shape's color
THEN I can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number)
WHEN I have entered input for all the prompts
THEN an SVG file is created named `logo.svg`
AND the output text "Generated logo.svg" is printed in the command line
WHEN I open the `logo.svg` file in a browser
THEN I am shown a 300x200 pixel image that matches the criteria I entered
```
